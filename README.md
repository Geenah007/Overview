# CMPG323-Overview-29628784

Welcome to my CMPG 323 project Overview. The CMPG 323 projects 1,2,3,4 and 5 will each have their own repositories which will follow the preferred Naming convention as required, and will further be intergrated into one KanBan project.

Branching Strategy that will be used: 

At this point in time the ideal Branching Strategy that will be used for the projects in the future is Git Flow. It allows you to have different branches for the different stages in the project's development  

.Gitignore File in each project: 

This file will be used to exclude files that were created in the development processes. These files will not be used or cimmitted to the repository. They are ignored by Git.
