# CMPG323-Overview-29628784

Welcome to my CMPG 323 project Overview. The CMPG 323 projects 1,2,3,4 and 5 will each have their own repositories which will follow the preferred Naming convention as required, and will further be intergrated into one KanBan project.

Names and brief description of the repositories to be created:

Project 1: CMPG 323 Overview
This is the project 1 repository that will be created and forms an introduction to the concepts of Agile and Scrum.

Project 2: CMPG 323 Project 2
The second project's repository will be created and used for API Development, specificially the CRUD RESTful API.

Project 3: CMPG Project 3
The third repository will be created and used to represent the architectural patterns, coding principles and the design patterns in respect to the project's requirements.

Project 4: CMPG Project 4
The fourth project's repository will be created and will focus on the Testing and Robotic Process Automation.

Project 5: CMPG Project 5
The fifth project's repository will be created and used for reporting and monitoring of the task at that point in time.

Branching Strategy that will be used: 
At this point in time the ideal Branching Strategy that will be used for the projects in the future is Git Flow. It allows you to have different branches for the different stages in the project's development. 

.gitignore File in each project: 
This file will be used to exclude files that were created in the development processes. These files will not be used or committed to the repository. They are ignored by Git. 

Storage of Credentials and Sensitive Information: 
Sensitive information and Credentials will be stored on my local machine under the "Passowords" Security feature. It needs the owner's (me) Facial Recognition to unlock any passwords. Access will only be granted by the owner and access will be granted to relevant personnel. The repositories are also set to private on GitHub esnuring that no one else besides the owner and specified personnel have access to everything.
